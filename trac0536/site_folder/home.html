	<hr/>

	<p>Hey! Welcome to my website. I'm sure you're a busy person and figuring out everything there is to offer here is a priority. Well sure it is! Quickly find what you need with links to my <a href="resume.html">Resume</a>, <a href ="interests.html">Interests</a>, and some personal <a href="reflections.html">reflections</a> on sundry topics. They're also listed at the top of your screen for future reference. When you are done looking around, please don't forget to sign the <a href="guestbook.html">guestbook</a> before you leave.</p>
	
	<p>Humankind is a mass of contradictions. I can claim no differently. A nature lover and admirer of untouched forest, I also enjoy making things from wood. I am a fisherman who refuses to catch anything lest the sting of hook weighs on those piscine minds lurking under troubled waters. Despairing of his fellow human, hope springs forth eternally. As a rabid reader, I haven't words to recall the reduction of my recreational reading recently. Onomatopoeia.</p>
	
	<p>Keep reading and don't forget to <a href="guestbook.html">sign the guestbook</a>.</p>

From the Text:<br/>
"2024 brings the Earth and Mars into alignment for a Low Energy Approach! Compared to our High Energy Approaches, you'll save an average of US $379,000 per-person! Softer engine burns and shorter transit times mean lower physical requirements, so don't forget to bring your grandma too!"

The culmination of a three month process learning Adobe InDesign, this project generated business cards, advertising posters (pictured), and a Style Guide. Space exploration is still a goal of mine, it's just taking a while. The picture on the left is pretty small, but the actual page it comes from is 100MB of thoughtful design.<br/>
Find more of my interests on my <a href="interests.html">interests</a> page. It makes sense when you think about it.
